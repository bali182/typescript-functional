Functional TypeScript  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bali182/typescript-functional.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bali182/typescript-functional)
=============================

The aim of this project is to bring real lazy functional stuff to java(type)script. It started out as a learning project, but it works pretty well&fast, so I tought I share it.

As a Java developer, I took what I tought was best from the functional part of Googles [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) Oracles [Stream API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html), and Scala.
